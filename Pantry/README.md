    Welcome to Pantry.com - Your cooking companion! This application is designed to enhance your online food shopping experience by keeping track of your purchases and providing personalized recipe recommendations based on your recent purchases. With this app, you'll never run out of meal ideas and can make the most out of your grocery shopping.
    Please note that this application is still in development. This is an ongoing project that I've been working on to practice front-end development on my path to becoming a full-stack engineer.
